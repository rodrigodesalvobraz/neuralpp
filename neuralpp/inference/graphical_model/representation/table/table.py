        Returns a tensor corresponding to the values indexed by given non-batch coordinates,
        that is, coordinates for dimensions that are not the batch row index dimension.
        A coordinate can be either an integer, slice(None), or an array-like object of integers
        To describe the result, let us divide into cases.
        If there are no multivalue coordinates and the table is not a batch,
        then the result is table[non_batch_slice_coordinates].
        This will be either a scalar, if there are no slice(None) coordinates, or a tensor-like object if there
        are slice(None) coordinates.
        If there are no batch coordinates and the table is a batch, then the result is
        M such that M_i is table[i, *non_batch_slice_coordinates],
        that is, for each row of the table batch, we apply the given non-batch coordinates.
        Note that this will be 1D is there were no slice(None) coordinates, and of greater dimensions otherwise.
        If there are batch coordinates and the table is not a batch, then the result is
        M such that M_i is table[*th(i, non_batch_slice_coordinates)] where
        th is a function that derives a tuple of values from non_batch_slice_coordinates using only the i-th
        element of each batch-coordinate (slice(None) coordinates are left alone).
        Note that this requires all batch coordinates to contain the same number of values.
        Finally, if table is a batch and there are batch coordinates, then the result is
        M such that M_i is table[i, *th(i, non_batch_slice_coordinates)], that is,
        we apply the same procedure for each row i.
